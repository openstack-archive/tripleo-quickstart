# Fetching the undercloud images can take a long time.  This
# tasklist caches images in `{{ image_cache_dir }}` if an image is
# (a) downloaded successfully and (b) successfully verifies against
# the checksum.  Images are cached using the checksum as the filename,
# and subsequent playbook runs will use the cached copy rather than
# trying to fetch the remote copy.

# This checks that the image_cache_dir directory exists.  When running
# the full quickstart, this is created by the provision/remote role.
# If you are running this role by itself, you will need to ensure that
# either the directory exists ahead of time or that ansible has the
# permissions to create the directory.
